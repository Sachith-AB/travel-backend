## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "No such file or directory"
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the `csv_import` directory when running the import.

### Error: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Ensure CSV files have read permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 *.csv
```

### Error: "Foreign key constraint violation"
**Solution**: Import files in the correct order (users ‚Üí guides/hotels ‚Üí related tables)

### Error: "Duplicate key value"
**Solution**: Check if data already exists. Either delete existing data or use different IDs.

---

## üßπ Clean Up (Optional)

If you need to remove the imported data:

```sql
-- Delete in reverse order to avoid foreign key violations
DELETE FROM room_amenities WHERE room_id BETWEEN 1 AND 15;
DELETE FROM room_images WHERE room_id BETWEEN 1 AND 15;
DELETE FROM rooms WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 15;

DELETE FROM hotel_amenities WHERE hotel_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
DELETE FROM hotel_images WHERE hotel_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
DELETE FROM hotel_license_photos WHERE hotel_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
DELETE FROM hotels WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;

DELETE FROM guid_nic_photos_back WHERE guid_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
DELETE FROM guid_nic_photos WHERE guid_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
DELETE FROM guid_slta_license_photos WHERE guid_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
DELETE FROM guid_specializations WHERE guid_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
DELETE FROM guid_languages WHERE guid_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
DELETE FROM guides WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;

DELETE FROM profile_pictures WHERE user_id BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
DELETE FROM users WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 10 AND role IN ('GUIDE', 'HOTEL_OWNER');
```
